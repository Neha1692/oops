        "\n",
        "ANS- Object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python is a programming model that uses classes and objects to create reusable code that models real-world concepts.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS-  Classes are templates that define the properties and behavior of objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS- An object is a unit of code that represents a specific aspect of a program.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS-Abstraction is a design-level process that hides implementation details, while encapsulation is an implementation-level process that controls access to data.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS- Dunder method are predefined methods in Python that add special functionality to classes and objects. They are recognized by the double underscore format, such as __methodname__.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.  Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS- Inheritance in object-oriented programming (OOP) is a fundamental concept that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class. This allows programmers to reuse code, create new classes, and establish relationships between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.  What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS- Polymorphism in object-oriented programming (OOP) is the ability to treat objects of different types as if they are the same type.\n",
        "\n",
        "8.How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS-Encapsulation in Python is achieved by using access modifiers to control access to a class's variables and methods. These access modifiers include public, private, and protected.\n",
        "\n",
        "9.What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS-A constructor in Python is a special method that is automatically called when an object of a class is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS-In Python, static methods and class methods are both types of methods that belong to a class. The main difference between them is that static methods are not bound to the objects of the class, while class methods are.\n",
        "\n",
        "11.What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS-Method overloading in Python is the ability to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS-Method overriding is a feature in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a subclass to replace a method in its superclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS- A property decorator in Python is a built-in decorator (@property) that allows a method to be accessed like an attribute, providing a way to implement getter, setter, and deleter methods in a Pythonic way.\n",
        "\n",
        "14.  Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS-Polymorphism is an important feature of object-oriented programming (OOP) because it allows programmers to write more efficient and flexible code.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS- An abstract class in Python is a class that can't be instantiated on its own, but is used as a blueprint for other classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS- Modularity\n",
        "\n",
        "OOP allows developers to break down complex systems into smaller, more manageable objects. This makes it easier to troubleshoot and collaborate.\n",
        "\n",
        "Reusability\n",
        "\n",
        "OOP allows developers to reuse code through inheritance, which saves time and reduces development costs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Flexibility\n",
        "\n",
        "OOP allows developers to adapt a single function to the class it's in, and to pass different objects through the same interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "Security\n",
        "\n",
        "OOP uses encapsulation and abstraction to hide complex code, which makes software more secure.\n",

        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS- An object-oriented programming, a class variable is shared by all instances of a class, while an instance variable is unique to each instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS-In Python, multiple inheritance is a feature that lets a class inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS- In Python, the __str__() and __repr__() methods are used to return string representations of objects. __str__() is used to create a readable representation for users, while __repr__() is used to create a detailed representation for developers.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS-The super() function in Python is a built-in function that allows access to methods and properties of a parent class from a child class. It is useful in object-oriented programming, especially when working with inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "21.  What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS- In Python, the __del__ method, also known as a destructor, is a special method that is called automatically when an object is about to be garbage collected, meaning it is invoked right before an object is removed from memory, after all references to it have been deleted; it is primarily used to perform any necessary cleanup tasks like releasing external resources held by the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS- In Python, the main difference between @classmethod and @staticmethod is that class methods can access and modify class attributes, while static methods cannot.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS- In Python, polymorphism with inheritance allows child classes to have the same method names as their parent class\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS-Method chaining is a syntax in Python that allows you to call multiple methods on an object in a single line of code.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS-The __call__ method in Python allows programmers to write classes that behave like functions. This allows the instances of the class to be called like functions.\n",
